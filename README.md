# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

- In order to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, we are required to analyze the Citibike NYC data for the month of August.
- The proposal is powered by Tableau to answer questions using data.

Following are questions we provide visual answers to:

How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
