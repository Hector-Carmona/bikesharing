## Overview of the analysis

- In order to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, we are required to analyze the Citibike NYC data for the month of August.
- The proposal is powered by Tableau to answer questions using data.

We analyze the data in order to response the following:

```
- How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
```

## Results

In this graph, it's shown the gender breakdown of Citi Bike riders that help us learn more about the customers, so we can determine how many males and females are the active riders.

The users by genderfor the Citidrive NYC in august is as follows:

```
 - Male: 1,530,272 users
 - Female: 588,431 users
 - Not Known: 225,251

"A likely concern of investors is the cost of bike upkeep. The bikes used most frequently will probably be the ones that require the most maintenance, so with this graphic we can determine which bikes have the highest number of rides and how much maintenance the bikes have to get.

Here we have graph that displays the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap.
he service is very appealing to those who want a hassle free way to travel to work.

The largest demand for the bikeshare service corresponds with the "rush hour" work commute:

6AM-10AM Mon - Fri
4PM-8PM Mon-Fri
Thursday is the busiest weekday
While weekday demand is largest, weekends are in demand as well:

Saturday 8AM-8PM
Sunday 9AM-8PM

In this visualization, is the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap.

While males use the service more heavily than females, the demand trend is pretty similar.

# Summary

We were able to give a broad analysis, in which we identified peak demand service hours, busiest days and also performed a deep dive into the users gender

Information about Des Moines is needed to determine if the service will appeal to potential users there. NYC is a very busy and expensive city, where the bikeshare service may not only save users money, but also time commuting.

- I would compare the NYC and Des Moineswork population, in order to give us an idea on the percentage of people that use the bike service based on the population of the city.
- Age is a factor in the services appeal to users and comparing the age of residents in each city would be insightful as well.
